At the core of NumPy is the ndarray, where nd stands for n-dimensional. An ndarray is a multidimensional array of elements all of the same type. In other words, an ndarray is a grid that can take on many shapes and can hold either numbers or strings. In many Machine Learning problems you will often find yourself using ndarrays in many different ways. For instance, you might use an ndarray to hold the pixel values of an image that will be fed into a Neural Network for image classification.
